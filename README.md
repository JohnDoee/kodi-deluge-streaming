## Description

This addon allows you to browse your torrents in Deluge. With the deluge-streaming installed
you are also able to stream torrents directly in Kodi.

## Where to download

You can find this addon here: https://github.com/JohnDoee/tidalstream-xbmc-plugin/releases
The streaming plugin can be found here: https://github.com/JohnDoee/deluge-streaming/releases and http://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=49679

## How to use

* Install Deluge Streaming on Deluge
If Deluge is not running locally (e.g. on a seedbox), you need to enable thin-client mode. A guide can be found here: http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/UserGuide/ThinClient

* Install addon
* Configure
* Watch

## Motivation

The goal is to spread the value of my deluge-streaming plugin by making it easier to use.
Share the access with friends, just add a bunch of stuff in paused state and your friends can get it downloaded by trying to watch it.

# Version Info

## Version 0.1.0
